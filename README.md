# Machine-Learning-Nano-Project-0

In this optional project, I created a decision function that attemptted to predict survival outcomes from the 
1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age. Starting with a a simple algorithm, I then
increased its complexity until an I could accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers 
in the provided data.
